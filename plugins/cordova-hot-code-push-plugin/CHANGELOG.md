# Change Log

## 1.0.3 (2015-10-02)

**Bug fixes:**

- Fixed [issue #8](https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-hot-code-push/issues/8). `ionic plugin add cordova-hot-code-push` will not hang. But from now on you will have to install CLI client manually.
- Fixed [issue #11](https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-hot-code-push/issues/11). `ionic state restore` will not hang any more.
- Fixed [issue #13](https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-hot-code-push/issues/13). Plugin is not gonna crash your application, if `content_url` is not set in the application config. Although, you should always set `content_url` in order for plugin to work.

**Enchancements:**

- As asked in [issue #12](https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-hot-code-push/issues/12) - plugin is not gonna show unnecessary messages in the console.
- Changed workflow on `chcpbuild.options`. From now on you should add `chcp-` prefix to the build options, when you use them with the `build` command: `cordova build -- chcp-buildOptionName`. More info can be found in the Readme.

- Removed unused node dependencies.
